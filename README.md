 ### Project Description:
The Python Exercises is an extensive compilation of more than 100 exercises designed to reinforce **programming logic** using the **Python** language. This collection encompasses a wide array of exercises that intricately leverage Python's fundamental functions. The exercises were skillfully presented and elucidated by Professor Gustavo Guanabara on his widely-followed YouTube channel, Curso em Vídeo. Through this resource, learners have the opportunity to delve into Python's core concepts and sharpen their programming skills, thanks to the clarity and depth of Guanabara's instructional approach.
